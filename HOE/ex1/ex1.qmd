Getting Started

## **Install/Launch R Packages**

This exercise uses the R packages *sf* and *tidyverse*.

1.  *sf* imports, manages and processes geospatial data

2.  *tidyverse* wrangles and visualises said data

Use p_load to install the packages into the environment:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)

```

## Download and Import Data

Download the following:

[Pre-Schools Location Data](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_a72bcd23e208d995f3bd4eececeaca43/view)

[Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary Data](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_d14da225fccf921049ab64238ff473d9/view)

[LTA Cycling Path Data](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/static-data.html)

[Singapore Airbnb Listing Data](https://data.insideairbnb.com/singapore/sg/singapore/2024-06-29/data/listings.csv.gz)

Inside the Ex1 folder, create a subfolder called *data*, and within that create 2 two more subfolders named *geospatial* and *aspatial* respectively.

Using st_read(), import the following geospatial data into R:


This code uses the st_read() function from sf to import the MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a polygon feature dataframe.
